            Semiconductor manufacturing has a significant impact on the environment due to its energy-intensive and resource-intensive nature. The manufacturing process involves the use of hazardous chemicals, such as solvents, acids, and gases, which can pose a risk to human health and the environment if not handled properly.
        </p>
        <p class="processfix">
            The production of semiconductor devices also requires significant amounts of water, which can strain local water resources in areas with limited water availability. Furthermore, the use of high-purity water in the manufacturing process can lead to the generation of wastewater containing high levels of contaminants, which must be treated before being discharged. 
        </p>
        <p class="processfix">Moreover, the disposal of semiconductor waste, including discarded or defective devices, can also have a significant impact on the environment. These devices often contain toxic materials, such as lead, arsenic, and mercury, which can leach into the soil and water if not disposed of properly. The recycling of semiconductor waste can mitigate these environmental impacts, but it requires specialized</p>
