        <h1>Solutions</h1>

        <p class="solutionsfix">To mitigate the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing, the industry has implemented various measures to reduce resource consumption, improve energy efficiency, and minimize waste generation. For example, manufacturers have implemented recycling programs for materials, improved production processes to reduce waste, and installed renewable energy sources to power manufacturing facilities.
            Regulatory bodies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have also implemented regulations to ensure that semiconductor manufacturing facilities comply with environmental standards and reduce their impact on the environment.</p>
        <p class="solutionsfix">In addition, semiconductor manufacturers have also focused on developing more sustainable products that have a lower environmental impact throughout their lifecycle. This includes using materials that are less harmful to the environment, designing products to be more energy-efficient, and extending the lifespan of products to reduce the need for frequent replacements.</p>
